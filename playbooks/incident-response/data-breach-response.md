This playbook provides step-by-step guidance for responding to a suspected or confirmed data breach. It should be activated immediately upon detection of unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## Prerequisites
- Access to incident management system
- Security team contact information
- Legal team contact information
- Communication templates prepared
- Access to audit logs and monitoring systems

## Scope
- **Covers**: Initial detection, containment, investigation, and immediate response

3. Determine if the breach is ongoing or contained
4. Classify the severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

- Communication channels established

### Step 3: Containment
Prevent further unauthorized access or data loss.

**Action items:**
1. Isolate affected systems (disable network access if needed)
2. Revoke compromised credentials
3. Block malicious IP addresses or user agents
4. Enable enhanced logging and monitoring
5. Preserve evidence for investigation

**Expected outcome:**
- Further data loss prevented
- Systems isolated as necessary
- Evidence preserved

### Step 4: Investigation
Determine the root cause and full extent of the breach.

**Action items:**
1. Review audit logs and access records
2. Identify the attack vector and timeline
3. Determine what data was actually accessed or exfiltrated
4. Identify all affected systems and users
5. Document findings in incident report

**Expected outcome:**
- Complete understanding of breach timeline
- Identification of affected data and systems
- Root cause determined

### Step 5: Notification

5. Inform executive leadership

**Expected outcome:**
- All required notifications sent
- Regulatory requirements met
- Stakeholders informed

## Verification
Confirm containment and proper execution:
1. Verify no ongoing unauthorized access
2. Confirm all compromised credentials have been rotated
3. Validate enhanced monitoring is in place
4. Ensure all notifications have been sent
5. Verify incident documentation is complete

## Rollback Procedure
N/A - This is a response playbook. If containment measures cause operational issues:
1. Consult with Incident Commander before restoring access
2. Ensure additional security controls are in place
3. Implement gradual restoration with enhanced monitoring

## Post-Execution
- Schedule post-incident review meeting within 48 hours
- Update security controls based on lessons learned
- Complete full incident report
- Update affected systems and security measures
- Provide team debriefing and training if needed
