# Database Backup and Recovery Playbook

## Overview
This playbook outlines the procedure for performing database backups and recovering from backup in case of data loss or corruption.

## Prerequisites
- Database administrator access
- Access to backup storage systems
- Backup and restore tools installed
- Understanding of database architecture
- Maintenance window (for production databases)

## Scope
- **Covers**: Full and incremental backups, point-in-time recovery
- **Does not cover**: Replication setup, migration to new hardware

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Database Administrator**: Executes backup and recovery procedures
- **Operations Lead**: Coordinates maintenance windows and stakeholder communication
- **Infrastructure Team**: Ensures storage and network resources are available

## Procedure

### Step 1: Pre-Backup Verification
Verify the database is in a consistent state and ready for backup.

**Action items:**
1. Check database health status
2. Verify sufficient storage space for backup (at least 2x database size)
3. Confirm backup destination is accessible
4. Review recent database logs for errors
5. Document current database size and state

**Expected outcome:**
- Database verified as healthy
- Storage space confirmed available
- Backup destination accessible

### Step 2: Initiate Backup
Execute the backup procedure based on backup type.

**Action items:**
1. Announce maintenance window if required (for offline backups)
2. Set database to backup mode if needed
3. Execute backup command with appropriate parameters
4. Monitor backup progress
5. Record backup start time and duration

**Expected outcome:**
- Backup process running successfully
- Progress being monitored
- No errors in backup logs

### Step 3: Verify Backup Integrity
Ensure the backup completed successfully and is valid.

**Action items:**
1. Check backup completion status
2. Verify backup file size is reasonable
3. Calculate and verify backup checksum
4. Test backup file accessibility
5. Document backup metadata (timestamp, size, checksum)
6. Update backup catalog/inventory

**Expected outcome:**
- Backup verified as complete and valid
- Metadata documented
- Backup inventory updated

### Step 4: Recovery (If Needed)
If recovery is required, follow these steps carefully.

**Action items:**
1. Assess the scope of data loss or corruption
2. Identify the appropriate backup to restore from
3. Notify stakeholders of recovery window
4. Stop application services that connect to the database
5. Execute restore command pointing to backup file
6. Monitor restore progress
7. Verify data integrity after restore
8. Restart application services

**Expected outcome:**
- Database restored to desired state
- Data integrity verified
- Services operational

## Verification
Confirm backup or recovery was successful:
1. Verify backup file exists and is accessible
2. Check backup completion logs for errors
3. Confirm backup metadata is documented
4. Test sample restore on non-production system (periodic validation)
5. For recovery: Verify critical data is present and accessible

## Rollback Procedure
If recovery causes issues:
1. Stop the restore process immediately
2. Assess what went wrong
3. Restore from previous known-good backup if available
4. Contact senior DBA or support if needed
5. Document the issue for post-mortem

## Post-Execution
- Update backup log with execution details
- Verify backup retention policy is being followed
- Archive or delete old backups per retention policy
- Document any issues or anomalies encountered
- Schedule next backup per backup policy
