# Data loss playbook sample

## Detection and Reporting

Ensure that information technology systems have appropriate detection and prevention mechanisms for malicious code and content.
Any actual or suspected breaches involving PII must be reported and investigated in accordance with existing incident response documentation.


## Initial Response

Upon detection of a PII data loss incident, immediately notify the relevant internal teams (e.g., Digital Safety, IT Security, Legal).
Isolate affected systems to prevent further data loss or unauthorised access.


## Containment

Remove sensitive information from affected systems or ensure it is properly anonymised.
Power down and disconnect compromised systems from the network if necessary.
Physically secure or destroy systems in accordance with disposal requirements.


## Investigation

Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope and impact of the data loss.
Document all findings and update relevant documentation, inventory records, and IT network diagrams.
Eradication and Recovery

Remove any malicious code or unauthorised access points.
Restore systems from verified backups, ensuring that restored data is anonymised if used in testing environments.
Verify the integrity of restored data and systems.


## Notification

Notify affected individuals and regulatory authorities as required by law and company policy.


## Post-Incident Review

Review the incident to identify root causes and areas for improvement.
Update policies, procedures, and training as necessary.


## Exception Handling

If deviations from standard procedures are required, raise an exception via the Digital Safety Hub or by contacting digital.safety@easyjet.com.
Ensure exceptions are risk assessed, presented at the Digital Safety Assurance Forum (DSAF), and recorded in the Digital Safety risk register.
Business Continuity

Ensure business continuity and incident response policies and plans are maintained and exercised at least once annually.
This playbook should be tailored to easyJetâ€™s specific systems and processes, and regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in technology, regulations, and business needs.

If you require a template or further guidance, refer to the incident response documentation and Digital Safety Hub on Inside, or contact the Digital Safety team directly.
