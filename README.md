# Sample Playbooks Repository

A repository for storing operational playbook documents in Markdown format. This repository provides structured, reusable procedures for common operational tasks, incident response, and security operations.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized location for maintaining playbooks that help teams:
- Respond consistently to incidents
- Execute operational procedures reliably
- Maintain security and compliance
- Onboard new team members with documented processes
- Reduce response time during critical situations

## Repository Structure

```
playbooks/
├── incident-response/    # Playbooks for handling security incidents and outages
├── operations/           # Operational procedures and maintenance tasks
├── security/            # Security-related procedures and access management
└── templates/           # Template files for creating new playbooks
```

## Available Playbooks

### Incident Response
- **[Data Breach Response](playbooks/incident-response/data-breach-response.md)** - Procedures for responding to data breaches

### Operations
- **[Database Backup and Recovery](playbooks/operations/database-backup-recovery.md)** - Database backup and restore procedures

### Security
- **[Access Revocation](playbooks/security/access-revocation.md)** - Procedures for revoking user access

## Using Playbooks

1. **Identify the appropriate playbook** for your situation
2. **Review prerequisites** before starting
3. **Follow each step sequentially** - don't skip steps
4. **Document your actions** as you execute the playbook
5. **Complete verification** steps to ensure success
6. **Update the changelog** in the playbook if you make improvements

## Creating New Playbooks

1. Copy the [playbook template](playbooks/templates/playbook-template.md)
2. Fill in all sections with specific, actionable steps
3. Place the playbook in the appropriate category directory
4. Update this README with a link to your new playbook
5. Submit a pull request for review

## Playbook Template Structure

Each playbook follows a standard structure:
- **Overview**: What the playbook covers and when to use it
- **Prerequisites**: Required access, tools, and conditions
- **Scope**: What is and isn't covered
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Who does what
- **Procedure**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Verification**: How to confirm success
- **Rollback Procedure**: What to do if something goes wrong
- **Post-Execution**: Follow-up actions
- **Related Resources**: Links to related documentation
- **Changelog**: History of updates

## Best Practices

- Keep playbooks up to date with current procedures
- Test playbooks regularly in non-production environments
- Include specific commands, not just descriptions
- Document expected outcomes for each step
- Link to related playbooks and resources
- Use clear, concise language
- Include troubleshooting guidance
- Maintain version history in the changelog
